Any new canvas points you create (e.g. when splitting triangles) must also be linked to a texture point (calculated by interpolating a suitable position within the texture image).

Remember: although canvas triangles that result from splitting a raw triangle will be flat topped/bottomed, their equivalent texture triangles will probably NOT be - so be careful ! 

Also take care when calculating the texture map pixel index values. Some of your calculations are likely to involve floating point values - if you don't convert these to integer index values in _the right way_ and also _at the right time_ there is the danger that you will get a "skewed" texture !
